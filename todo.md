- Fix regular text in plaintext files being colored with a dark gray (still broken)
- fix markdown view/parsing
- Fix python double lsp (I want to use basedpyright and ruff)
    1. Code actions aren't going to the correct pop up, they should pop up as a menu as they do for other plugins, not on the bottom in the cmd buffer
    2. Double lsp leads to inlay hints being active for both
    3. I thought interop with two lsps would be more useful, maybe not
        a) If so, look into making ruff behave more like basedpyright and just move on
- Fix Trouble popup
 1. No longer have the "TroubleToggle" command
 2. Asks for trouble mode, out of a list of like 20 options
