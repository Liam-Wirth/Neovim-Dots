# Credit to these lovely people!
    [WBThomason](https://github.com/wbthomason) :
I ~~stole~~ borrowed a lot from how he implemented lspconfiguration [here]("lua/plugins/lsp/lspconf")
    
[the LazyVim Team](https://www.lazyvim.org/):
although I never used the editor, I really enjoyed how they setup and organized all of their configurations, and used their [repository](url) as a sort of "guide" for how 
I wanted to go about making my dots (without necessarily copy and pasting things)
